Brief description
This project is an online delivery service where it gives us a chance to have a sneak peek on how company developers program their softwares in order to serve those customers who can not leave their houses. This project shows us that by using c programming language we are able to make a program that can get information from customers and be able to get their orders and at the same time give them the satisfaction and comfort that they need from deliveries.
